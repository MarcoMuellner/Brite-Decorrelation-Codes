Notes:
HD31237 - OK.
HD33111 - OK.
HD34085 - RIGEL. OK, but the star is severely overexposed. DR2 data lack some parameters
          that would allow to account well for some instrumental effects.
HD34503 - Option '--excl' used in BAb4 and UBr7 in the vicinity of the brightening (~720).
HD35411 - OK.
HD35468 - Moon effect in UBr7 - some data at the lowest Moon elongations removed.
HD35715 - OK.
HD36486 - OK.
HD36861 - OK.
HD37043 - Option '--excl' used in all three setups in the vicinity of the heartbeats.
HD37128 - OK.
HD37468 - OK.
HD37742 - OK.
HD38771 - OK.
HD39801 - BETELGEUSE. Final part of UBr7 removed due to bad quality. The star is severely
          overexposed in the red filter (UBr7). DR2 data lack some parameters that would
          allow to account well for some instrumental effects.
